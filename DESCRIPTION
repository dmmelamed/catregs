Description: Several functions for working with mixed effects regression models for limited dependent variables. The functions facilitate post-estimation of model predictions or margins, and comparisons between model predictions for assessing or probing moderation. Additional helper functions facilitate model comparisons and implements simulation-based inference for model predictions of alternative-specific outcome models.
